## IVA calculator

"""This calculator will receive payments for a person, and will calculate the IVA tax amount for each payment, and the sum of all the taxes. The program will have the following menu:

```
CALCULADORA DE IVA
==============================
1. Registrar nuevo pago
2. Ver lista de pagos registrados
3. Ver total de pago e impuestos
4. Salir
```

`Option 1`: Write a function to handle add a new payment. After the user enters the value, calculate the IVA of that value (16%). Save both values (you can use variables, lists, dict).

`Option 2`: Print all the payment registered and it's IVA tax. For example
```
    Pago #1 -> Monto: $3000.00 MXN -> IVA: $480.00 MXN
    Pago #2 -> Monto: $1000.00 MXN -> IVA: $160.00 MXN
```

`Option 3`: Print the sum of all the payment, as the sum of all the IVA taxes values

```
    TOTAL DE PAGOS: $4000.00 MXN
    TOTAL DE IVA: $640.00 MXN
```
The program must show until the user enter 4 to exit."""
